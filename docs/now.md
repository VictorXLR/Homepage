## Home
- Im writing this site, This is my third iteration and hopefully final iteration of this blog, I want to use it to host a lot more fun projects and just genuinely write more code.
- I used Vue.js because its fun to learn, a lot more easy to learn and the Vuepress documentation is awesome. It just felt right and im glad i stuck to it

## Programming
- Picking up more Node and Rust this break, hopefully using this to build valuable stuff and actually deploy to production servers and not leave my code at `localhost`
