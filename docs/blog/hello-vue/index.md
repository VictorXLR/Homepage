# Hello World
This is the first post published utilizing Vue Press generator on the 31st of december 2019. I decided to make a blog and focus on writing about my interests, thoughts and cement a place for me on the internet. 

My Interests are very tech focus and I enjoy coding, anime, action movies and comic books. I am the first of 3 brothers and I plan to work for a company data focused like Twitter or start my own.

I used the Hugo-Kiera theme for my website but i had to modify it so i could use a light theme.

This is what my old website used to look like. I used Vue.js
