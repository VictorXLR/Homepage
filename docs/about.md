## About Me
My name is Victor, I am a software developer currently in my final year of studying computer science at Dalhousie University. Im into computer security, functional programming, music and videogames.

I am still in the process of putting things together, so this page is a bit unstructured. 

As of right now, im working on my Honors and also searching for a full time job by the end of summer 2020.

This blog will tend to be unstructured covering my interests, work and other interesting topics.
